## üéØ Judge Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does the threat detection work?"
**A**: "We use multiple approaches: heuristic analysis for domain patterns, OSINT integration for known threats, and machine learning for anomaly detection. The system scores domains from 0-100 based on various indicators like typosquatting, recent registration, SSL status, and threat intelligence feeds."

### Q: "What makes this different from existing solutions?"
**A**: "CyberGuard combines real-time OSINT feeds with heuristic analysis in a single platform. Most solutions focus on either known threats or behavioral analysis - we do both. Plus, our hackathon-friendly architecture makes it easy to deploy and customize."

### Q: "How do you handle false positives?"
**A**: "Our multi-layered approach reduces false positives significantly. We use confidence scoring, require multiple indicators, and provide manual override capabilities. Security teams can mark alerts as false positives, and the system learns from these decisions."

### Q: "What's the scalability like?"
**A**: "The architecture is designed for scale. We use MongoDB for flexible data storage, Node.js for high-performance APIs, and React for responsive frontend. The OSINT fetcher can be scaled horizontally, and we support rate limiting and caching for high-volume scenarios."

### Q: "How do you ensure data security?"
**A**: "We implement enterprise-grade security: JWT authentication with refresh tokens, bcrypt password hashing, CORS protection, rate limiting, input validation, and secure headers. All API communications are encrypted, and we follow OWASP security guidelines."
